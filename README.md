# Product-Catalog-Viewer
Product Catalog Viewer is a full-stack demo that transforms raw Kaggle data into an interactive shopping interface. A Jupyter notebook cleans and exports products to JSON, a Flask backend uses OpenAI to turn natural-language queries into filters, and a React frontend lets users refine by keywords, category, price, and NLP search.
